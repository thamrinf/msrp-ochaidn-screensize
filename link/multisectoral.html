                  <b>Education:</b> Recent revisions to the national guidelines supporting school re-opening at both primary and secondary levels for learners across nearly half the country’s districts deemed low-to-moderate risk. A UNICEF supported digital assessment of over 4000 students suggests that 87% cent of them are eager to return to school despite concerns with COVID-19.

                <p>
                  <b>WASH:</b> UNICEF’s WASH and the Data and Analytics team have been supporting a national digital platform assessing the ‘new normal’ guidelines which includes real-time independent monitoring of handwashing, safe distancing, and mask-usage. As part of WASH advocacy and technical support to provincial and district governments in Papua, and as part of the Reopening of Schools Protocol, UNICEF has developed a WASH data analysis and costing tool to assess the gap in WASH services in schools and funding requirements. UNICEF has supported the Handwashing Technical Guidance for schools and public places and institutions, which were endorsed by the Ministry of Education and Culture ( MOEC) and the Ministry of Health (MOH)  and disseminated to all 514 districts in 34 provinces.

                  WHO has been supporting the MoH with webinars on waste management since 2 June.  As of 06 July, 9,684 participants have been trained from 20 provinces. The Ministry of Environment and Forestry (MoEF), the MoH and WHO presented current policies on solid and liquid waste management, water, sanitation and hygiene as well as the use of incinerators and autoclaves.

                <p>Shelter Sub-Cluster members remain concerned about:</p>
                  <li>The remnant post-disaster shelter support needs of communities still recovering in Palu and Lombok. Almost 2 years on from these twin disasters it is less and less clear who remains in need of assistance living in inadequate temporary or incomplete shelters.</li>
                  <li>Loss of livelihoods is resulting in increasing rates of evictions of both renters and mortgagees in urban centres. Loss of income has extended for so long now that even households on longer term contracts and those with mortgages are now facing potential éviction. The exact numbers of those affected are yet unknown.</li>
                  <li>Increasing need for self-isolation and quarantine facilities. This includes helping communities to overcome stigmatism of those suspected of having COVID-19, as well as then training communities on how to select and manage appropriate self isolation / quarantine facilities.</li>
                  <li>Congestion in camps, informal settlements and slums leading to increased COVID-19 risk.</li>
                  <li>Need for medical related accommodation for medical staff closer to place of work and families of those seeking medical assistance.</li>
                  <li>Concern about preparedness and contingency planning for parallel disaster during a pandemic. Over the last 20 years large scale natural disasters have regularly struck Indonesia with the shelter sector, commonly the most impacted and requiring the greatest level of response. Cluster partners remain concerned about how to effectively respond to a parallel disaster, when all resources are already severely stretched and restrictions on movement and interaction still apply</li>

                  Gaps in shelter needs remain difficult to determine with any accuracy. The shelter Sub-cluster are currently planning for a joint rapid SMS based assessment in both Lombok and Palu and the broader COVID-19 impact to provide clearer understanding of emerging and preexisting needs.

                  The shelter sector remains significantly underfunded. While it is clear that the impact of COVID-19 is far greater than just health, there has been limited donor or government attention on emerging needs in the shelter sector. An increasing number of households are facing growing insecurity of tenure as loss of livelihoods impacts both on renters and homeowners.

                  The second phase of a national assessment was conducted to monitor the effectiveness of off-line learning through TV broadcasts of the Ministry of Education and Culture (MoEC) by using UNICEF’s RapidPro platform. A survey on the wider effectiveness of learning from home was conducted targeting parents and students across Indonesia, with a specific focus in Papua remote areas

                  UNICEF and MoEC conducted a series of webinars aimed at teachers’ capacity building with a focus on the topics related to both safe school reopening and continuation of home-based learning. More than 8,000 teachers across the country have attended the webinar series.

                  An online survey has been conducted by UNICEF to capture adolescents’ views and perceptions on home-based learning and school reopening, and received more than 4,000 responses from students in all 34 provinces. The survey results demonstrate the majority of students are eager to return to school: about two-thirds (66 per cent) said they feel uncomfortable studying from home and a majority (87 per cent) said they want to go back to school soon. When asked about going back to school amid the pandemic, half of respondents said they believe it would be best to return once the number of COVID-19 cases is reduced.

                  UNICEF has supported the MoEC on the monitoring of school reopening including development of systematic data collection, analysis and visualization mechanisms. Findings have indicated around 400 out of 514 districts and cities from all risk zones have already initiated preparation for school reopening, applying necessary health and safety protocols.

                  To promote safe return to school and address potential COVID-19 related concerns regarding out-of-school children, UNICEF is supporting the Government in conducting ‘Back-to-Learn Campaign.’ This targets parents, school communities and local governments with key information materials on safe re-opening (e.g. health protocols, simplified curriculum).

                  UNICEF supported the development of national school reopening guidelines for the new academic year which resumed on 13 July 2020. Initially only schools in the “green” districts at low COVID-19 risk could reopen for face-to-face learning. However, recent revisions as of 7 August 2020 allow greater numbers of schools to reopen in both green and yellow districts if schools fulfil the minimum safety requirements. This would allow 49% of schools to re-open with others continuing distance learning.

                  A rapid assessment of home-based learning among children with disabilities is being conducted with UNICEF’s support. This aims to gather information on the needs, challenges and recommendations based on the learning experiences of children with disabilities during the COVID-19. The study will be finalized in mid-August 2020 and will inform guidance on learning from home for these children.

Disinfection protocols and services have been implemented in 1,202 healthcare facilities, 196 schools and 2300 public places. Handwashing with soap stations have been installed in 408 HCFs, 59 schools and 193 public places. Through the Indonesian Red Cross Society, Unilever soap bars were distributed to 132,700 households. To operationalize WASH and Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) protocols, UNICEF supported 37 trainings for health care centers and trained 651 health facility staff. Orientation sessions for setting up handwashing with soap (HWWS) units and ensuring good operations and maintenance are conducted for the provincial and district offices.

                  UNICEF provided lead technical and advocacy support to the government in celebrating World Breastfeeding Week from 1-7 August in the context of COVID-19 pandemic. A few landmark events were organized, including a series of webinars and talk shows engaging thousands of key stakeholders to highlight the importance of breastfeeding during the pandemic, and to launch a national breastfeeding campaign. UNICEF and WHO issued a joint press release, which resulted in a national media coverage urging government and stakeholders to prioritize services and programmes to protect, promote and support breastfeeding as a critical component of the health and nutrition response during the pandemic.

                  Engaging school age children and adolescents on nutritional issues has been a key focus area of UNICEF.

UNICEF also conducted and disseminated findings from a U-Report survey on adolescent dietary intake, physical activity and utilization of nutrition services during the pandemic.
