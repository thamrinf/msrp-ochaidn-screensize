                  Working through the Ministry of Health, UNICEF has designed a
                  platform for tracking COVID-19 related capacity gaps across
                  all public and private hospitals in the country. Technical
                  protocols for this platform have been disseminated to 834

                  At least 70 doctors and 50 nurses have died from COVID-19 in
                  Indonesia, with hundreds more contracting the disease while
                  fighting the pandemic. The Indonesian Medical Association
                  (IDI) estimated that between 200 and 300 doctors have been
                  infected by the virus, while the National Nurses Association
                  (PPNI) stated that at least 300 nurses have contracted the
                  disease.

                  Health resources have significantly increased. From the
                  initial 132 referral hospitals, there are now 668 referral
                  hospitals, with 166,233 beds and 2,338 isolation rooms.
                  However, these remain low when considered against the total
                  number of people in Indonesia.

                  Prior to COVID-19, 5.4 million pregnant women per year
                  required Ante Natal Care, Intra Natal Care, and Post Natal
                  Care services, as well as 30 million couples of childbearing
                  age needed family planning services. Interrupted reproductive
                  health services are causing immediate and long-term issues.

                  An assessment of immunization services among over 5,000 health

                  28 percent of Puskesmas (community health centers) are not

                  Puskesmas experienced a reduction in the number of visits
                  which is likely to impact the provision of Reproductive Health

                  A 40 percent reduction of new Family Planning users in March
                  compared to February 2020 means that unmet needs for Family
                  Planning have likely increased.

                  Reproductive Health services are needed for 5.4 million

                  At least 900 private practicing midwives closed their services

                  WHO and UNICEF published a joint press release to commemorate

                  government and stakeholders to safeguard and promote access to

                  practices during the COVID-19 pandemic.

                  The MoH, supported by WHO, is conducting a comprehensive field
                  assessment to identify best practices, gaps and challenges and
                  develop contextualized recommendations for provinces to
                  strengthen the COVID-19 response. The assessment tool was
                  piloted in nine provinces: Banten, East Java, North Maluku,
                  North Sulawesi, Papua, South Sulawesi, West Java, West Papua
                  and Yogyakarta. WHO assisted the MoH in a country-level
                  Intra-Action Review (IAR) during the second week of August.
                  The global IAR guidelines and facilitators’ packages were
                  translated to Indonesian and adapted to the country context
                  and around 100 participants were trained from multiple sectors
                  to conduct the IAR. The results of the field assessment and
                  the IAR will be used to guide the development of national and
                  province-specific recommendations when updating the provincial
                  and national COVID-19 response plans

                  during COVID-19 service delivery, and the establishment of an

                  IPC and to assess nurses’ exposure to the virus.
