                  In March 2020, BPS (Statistics Indonesia) indicated that the country’s poverty increased by 0.37% compared to last year’s figure, meaning that there are 1.28 million Indonesians that fell into poverty. In rural area, the poverty increases from 12.62% to 12.82%, while in urban area it increased from 6.56% to 7.38%. The trend is expected to increase.

                  Remittances of Indonesian migrant workers dropped by 10% between the first quarter of 2020 compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Updated estimates indicate that total remittance receipts for the year will decrease by at least 13% due to reduced opportunities for Indonesian migrant workers to go and maintain their livelihoods abroad.
